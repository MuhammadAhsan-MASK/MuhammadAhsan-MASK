I am a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my degree with strong interests in Web Development, Mobile App Development, and a growing focus on Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning.

I am actively learning Flutter and Dart for cross-platform app development, exploring backend development using Node.js and PHP, and deepening my expertise in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

In addition to development, I’m expanding my knowledge in Data Science tools and concepts, including Power BI for data visualization and reporting, and foundational skills in AI and machine learning.

I enjoy working on real-world projects that challenge my skills and help me grow. I’m open to collaborating on mobile apps, web development, data-driven solutions, and open-source contributions. Always eager to learn, build, and contribute to meaningful work.
